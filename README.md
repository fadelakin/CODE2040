CODE2040 API Challenge
========

This is a repository for the CODE2040 API Challenge for the Fellows Program. It's written in Java. I will try to write it in multiple languages if possible though. 

To run the Java files, first of all make sure Java is installed on your computer by running ```java -version```. If it is, then just run ```java [name of file]``` since most of the files have already been compiled.

Do note that due to ```.gitignore``` being added, the library files are not included in this repo. The library I'm using is java-json library. It can be found.......truth be told I lost the link. I'll update it when I find it again. Oops.
