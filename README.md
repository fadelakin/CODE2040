CODE2040 API Challenge
========

This is a repository for the CODE2040 API Challenge for the Fellows Program. It's written in Java.

All the files are compiled through the command line or at least that's how I did it.

Do note that due to ```.gitignore``` file being added, the library files are not included in this repo.
